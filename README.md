## Java Invetory Program

Java program that reads three lists of size N, corresponding to:

1: The product code
2: The quantity in the warehouse of the product.
3: The minimum quantity required of the product.

For the inventory system, it is important to know if it is necessary to request a certain product from your supplier according to the minimum quantity required. An algorithm is required that:

● Read the number of products.
● Read the 3 lists and store each list in a vector.
Once the data is read:
● Indicate the codes of the products for which orders must be placed.
● Indicate the code of the product with the highest and lowest number of units in the warehouse.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
